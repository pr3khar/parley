          This inspired us to develop a virtual reality application that simulates variable crowd settings in multiple locations to enable users to practice and improve their speech delivery.
          It comes with added features like the ability to modify the crowd's volume which acts as background noise and is an important metirc to consider and practice for while delivering speeches.
          It also provdes a real-time feedback of the speaker's sentiment and tone along with the pace enabling the speaker to modulate between practices. 
          <br><br>
          One such scenario where such a device might come handy is:
          Ram has always been unsure about his speaking skills, feeling he is unable to properly convey his thoughts especially in stressful situations like when speaking to a crowd. So he takes up the Speech Training Glasses to help improve his skills.  He has the ability to upload his speech to the application and start, he can change his situation as he wants from a gymnasium to an open ground. He can also select the size of the crowd along with its rowdy-ness. This includes how much the audience themselves are talking along with the general tone of the place. While speaking the app records and analysis his speech through along with comparing it to the text given to it. Afterwards it gives Ram the statistics including the pacing and areas where he might have made a mistake or even forgot.  This helps him in preparing for big speeches of all types along with giving him the confidence to appear in front of any crowd.

            Virtual Reality is a simulated experience in a virtual environment that is interactive and can be explored by the user. It provides the user with a safe and no-risk environment and practice and improve in realistic scenarios. It allows the user to expereince different scenarios remotely, as per the user's convenience. Altogether, it also inspires a fun and intuitive way to develop speaking skills as virtual reality in itself is pretty interesting and engaging.

            Different types of audiences and their behaviour has the capacity to dictate the outcome of various speeches. Hence, we provide our users with the option to switch between variabe crowd sizes and crowd volumes. The option to switch between different settings is provided in the pause menu where the user can switch choose from low, medium and high for either of the variables. This allows the user to test themselves in a variety of conditions and situations and provides a more complete learning experience.

            Parléy provides the user with real-time feedback during their sessions. The feedback consists of important metrics like "Words per Minute" which determines the pace of the speech, "sentiment analysis" which provides insights into the tone of the speech. Both these metrics are depicted using odometers for easy understanding without much disturbance. It also recognizes the number of times you say cuss words in your speech and displays them at the bottom of the screen to indicate the user.
